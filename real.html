		<h1><u>LIFE EXPERIENCES TILL NOW</u></h1>
		<br>
		<p><u>GIVING UP</u> After a number of encounters i had with schools, family, friends and many other people, my life mostly makes sence to me. I mean to talk about my success story so far.
			<br>
			If there is one thing i have learnt, then it's NEVER to give up on whatever i am doing or plan on doing. My parents and teachers have always told me that; LIFE IS NEVER A RACE NOR IS IT WAR FIELD TO COMPETE FOR SOMETHING. I have always challenged myself to do he things that are way challenging than those that are less challenging. 
			<br>
			BELIEVE ME, IT WORKS!!</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2><u>MY AIM IN LIFE</u></h2>
			<br>
			<p> To make other young ladies in African feel loved and recognized when it comes to their education. Many call me a FEMINIST but i believe working for equal rights in everyting is the BEST way forward as a nation.
				<br>
				I also work at making my parents proud by accomplishing my goal which is to become ONE OF THE WORLD-KNOWN BEST FEMALE MATHEMATICIANS.
